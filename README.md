## Paper-Summaries
I will be posting summaries of research papers I love.

Topics I read about :
* CSCW
* HCI
* Ubi Comp
* Blockchain
* Interactive Visualization

I do not post summaries of all the papers I read. For a few papers that I liked but did not find them very relevant to me , I upload their highlighted and annotated versions here - (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1e1ESi78Fth_3p-OY2AjrTI5ZSPsl5RDM?usp=sharing)

All the papers were legally downloaded with access provided by IIT Madras.
