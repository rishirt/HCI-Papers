## Social Computing
Social Computing is an area of computer science that is concerned with the interaction of social behaviour and computational systems.

In this repo , I'll be posting summaries and commentaries of papers I liked reading. Please read this [page](https://hcicourses.stanford.edu/cs376/2018/critique_format.php)by Michael Benrstein on writing a good commentary.

My main motivations for doing this are - personal archiving and to enable someone without a formal background in the subject get started without going through the trouble of finding relevant and quality literature like I did. 

Topics :
* CSCW
* Crowd Sourcing
* Human Computation

I do not post all the papers I read. For a few papers that I like but do not find them very relevant to me , I upload their highlighted and commented versions here - (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1e1ESi78Fth_3p-OY2AjrTI5ZSPsl5RDM?usp=sharing)

All the papers were legally downloaded with access provided by IIT Madras.
